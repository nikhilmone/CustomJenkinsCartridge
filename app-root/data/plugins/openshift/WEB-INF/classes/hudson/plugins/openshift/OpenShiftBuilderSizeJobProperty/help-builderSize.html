  <p><b>Important:</b> This setting only applies if you set the job <i>Label Expression</i> to match the <i>Project name</i> of your job.</p>
  <p>
  Setting the job label is done automatically for you by the OpenShift client tools, but if you are manually setting
  up a job, you need to set this.  You can set the <i>Label Expression</i> by checking <i>Restrict where this project can be run</i>
  and then copying your <i>Project name</i> into the text field.  The label is used to lookup the job details, including 
  the <i>Builder Type</i> and <i>Builder Size</i> when your slave builders are created.
  </p>

  <p>
    The builder size specifies the resources needed for your OpenShift build environment.
